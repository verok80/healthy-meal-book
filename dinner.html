                              <code>
                              8 large chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
                              OR 10 chicken drumsticks; 4 medium chicken breasts
                              2 tbsp cooking oil, I use avocado oil
                              sea salt and ground black pepper
                              2 tbsp butter
                              1 large shallot, diced
                              15 whole garlic cloves
                              1 sprig fresh rosemary
                              1 sprig fresh thyme
                              1 tbsp honey, or maple syrup
                              zest from 1 lemon
                              1 large lemon, thinly sliced
                              10 to 15 spears green asparagus, chopped
                              sea salt and ground black pepper
                              1 cup chicken broth
                              1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
                              zest from 1 lemon
                              For Serving:
                              pasta, rice or potatoes</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Preheat the oven to 375F/190C. Season the chicken generously all over with salt and pepper.</p>
                              <p>Preheat a large, oven-safe pan over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of cooking oil. I like to use avocado oil. The pan needs to be extra hot and the oil should be smoking lightly.</p>
                              <p>Add the chicken into the hot pan, skin-side down first. Fry the chicken in batches to avoid over crowding the pan. Turn the chicken once the skin is golden and crispy, then fry on the other side for 3 to4 minutes.</p>
                              <p>The chicken will not be completely cooked at this stage. Remove the fried chicken from the pan and onto a clean tray; set it aside while you prepare the sauce.</p>
                              <p>Into the same pan you used for the chicken, add a few tablespoons of butter and reduce the heat to a medium. Into the melted butter, add the diced shallot, whole garlic cloves, thyme and rosemary.</p>
                              <p>Sauté this mixture for 5 to 7 minutes, until the shallot is translucent and tender. Next, add in the zest of 1 large lemon to the pan. Add the honey in next, then add the sliced lemon.</p>
                              <p>Continue to cook the mixture for a few more minutes, until the lemon starts to soften.</p>
                              <p>Add the chopped asparagus into the pan, over the lemon sauce. Season the asparagus with salt and pepper. Pour the chicken broth over the asparagus.</p>
                              <p>Return the pan-fried chicken back into the pan, arranging it over the top of the asparagus. Bring the chicken broth up to a simmer.</p>
                              <p>Roast the chicken, uncovered, at 375F/190C for 20 to 25 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165F/74C. This timing will vary depending on the size of your chicken. Chicken breast will take longer.</p>
                              <p>Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and sprinkle fresh dill over the top. Add more fresh lemon zest over the top for more lemon flavor.</p>

                              <code>
                              4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
                              1 tbsp cooking oil
                              OR: 6 large chicken thighs
                              OR: 6 to 8 large chicken drumsticks
                              OR: 18 to 20 chicken party wings
                              For Teriyaki Sauce:
                              1/4 cup soy sauce
                              1/4 cup water
                              1/4 cup brown sugar
                              1 tbsp sesame seed oil
                              1 tbsp rice vinegar
                              5 to 6 garlic cloves, pressed or finely minced
                              1 tbsp ginger, pureed or grated
                              1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch, or 1 tbsp arrowroot powder
                              2 tbsp water
                              sesame seeds, for garnish; optional
                              chopped cilantro, for garnish; optional
                              </code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>First, prepare the teriyaki sauce marinade. In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the soy sauce, water, sugar, sesame seed oil, rice vinegar, garlic and ginger. Whisk for about 30 seconds until the ingredients are well combined.</p>
                              <p>Arrange the chicken in a deep casserole tray or place into a ziplock bag (doubled!). Pour the prepared marinade over the chicken and turn until it’s well coated all over. Marinate the chicken for a minimum of 1 hour, turning after 30 minutes. Ideally, I recommend marinating the chicken overnight. Once the chicken is marinated, remove it from the sauce and lightly pat dry with paper towels. Reserve the leftover marinade!</p>
                              <p>Preheat the oven to 425F/218C. Preheat a large stainless steel or cast iron pan over medium-high heat and add a few tablespoons of oil. Once the pan and oil are extra hot, carefully add in the marinated chicken. For chicken breasts, fry them on each side for about 5 to 6 minutes, until well browned all over. For other cuts of chicken, do the same: fry on all sides until the outside is well browned.</p>
                              <p>Pour the remaining teriyaki sauce over the browned chicken and let the sauce come up to a simmer; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chicken into the preheated oven and finish cooking in the oven. Whichever cut of meat you use, the internal temperature needs to reach 165F/74C. For smaller chicken breasts, bake for 7 to 10 minutes; for larger breasts, bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Bone-in drumsticks and chicken thighs can take 18 to 22 minutes. Boneless chicken thighs bake in approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Bone-in party wings will take approximately 10 to 12 minutes. All timing is approximate and may increase or decrease depending on size!</p>
                              <p>Once the chicken is done cooking, remove it from the pan onto a clean tray and bring the sauce back up to a simmer over medium heat. In a small ramekin, combine the cornstarch and water and stir to combine. Add the slurry to the sauce and whisk it in; the sauce will start to thicken immediately. Whisk the sauce for about 1 minute, then remove it from heat. Return the prepared chicken back into the pan and turn until it’s well coated in the teriyaki glaze. Enjoy the chicken immediately for best flavor.</p>

First, carefully portion the rack of lamb into single chops using a large, sharp knife. Turn the rack towards yourself to see the bones for easier portioning. Place the portioned chops into a casserole dish. Watch my video recipe to see how it’s done.</p>
                              <p>Drizzle a the olive oil over the lamb chops, then season generously with coarse salt and black pepper; I recommend using Maldon salt flakes or kosher salt. Season both sides of the lamb chops. Next, sprinkle the fresh herbs over the chops. Gently press the pressed garlic into the chops so it sticks better to the meat. Drizzle the vinegar and wine over the chops and turn them to ensure they are well coated. Marinate the chops for 30 minutes in the refrigerator, turning after 15 minutes to marinate the meat evenly.</p>
                              <p>While the lamb chops are marinating, prepare your choice of dipping sauces and side dishes. Check out my recommendations above in my recipe post! Once the lamb is marinated, preheat an outdoor grill to 500F for 5 minutes, until the grill grates are extra hot. Reduce the flame to medium and add the lamb chops, spacing them 3 to 4 inches apart.</p>
                              <p>Grill the chops for 2 to 3 minutes per side, more for thicker chops. Once both sides are grilled, transfer them to the top rack of the grill, or to the side. Finish cooking the lamb with indirect heat for another 2 to 3 minutes. These instructions are for medium-done chops. Grill for 1 minute less per side for medium-rare doneness. Ensure that the temperature reaches 145F. Remove the chops from the grill and let the meat rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
                              <p>For the tzatziki sauce: gently peel the cucumber(s) and remove large seeds, if desired. Grate the cucumber(s) into a bowl lined with a cheesecloth; you’ll need approximately 1 1/2 cups of grated cucumber. Season the cucumber lightly with salt and let it stand for 5 minutes to release water. Wring the cucumbers of excess water as much as possible. Place the grated cucumber into a large bowl with the greek yogurt, pressed garlic, chopped dill and mint. Add the olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. If desired, add also 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.</p>

                              <p class="description"><strong>Easy, grilled cedar plank salmon with lemon, garlic and herb seasoning. Plus, easy asparagus side dish recipe!</strong></p>
                              <p>Ingredients:</p>
                              <code>
                              2 to 2.5 pound salmon fillet
                              salt to season
                              1/2 cup butter, melted
                              3 garlic cloves, finely minced
                              2 tbsp fresh dill
                              1 tbsp capers, minced
                              zest from 1 large lemon
                              1 tsp salt
                              ground black pepper
                              For Asparagus:
                              1 large bundle asparagus
                              1 to 2 tbsp olive oil
                              salt to season
                              zest from 1/2 lemon
                              For Grilling:
                              2 cedar planks, presoaked</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Presoak the cedar planks for at least 30 minutes, but preferably for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat your grill when ready to prepare the dish. If you’re using a Traeger grill, set it first to ‘smoke’ and preheat for 10 minutes. If using a conventional grill, preheat the grill to 450F.</p>
                              <p>Prepare the butter topping: melt the butter in a large bowl. Finely mince the garlic and capers, then add to the melted butter along with the fresh dill, lemon zest, salt and a bit of ground black pepper. Stir all the ingredients together, then place the bowl into the refrigerator to chill for at least 10 to 15 minutes. The butter needs to thicken into a spread.</p>
                              <p>Prepare the salmon: the fish can be grilled with the skin on or off. Use a very sharp knife to remove the skin; watch my video recipe to see how it's done. The salmon can be prepared as a whole piece or cut into serving size pieces.</p>
                              <p>Season the salmon all over lightly with salt, then place onto the pre-soaked cedar planks. Using a spatula, spread the prepared herb butter on top of the salmon generously.</p>
                              <p>Wash the asparagus and cut off the hard ends. Place the asparagus on a flat sheet pan or tray and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and lemon zest.</p>
                              <p>Head out to the grill! For the Traeger grill, I first smoked the salmon and asparagus for 20 minutes, then turned the temperature up to 'grill', about 425F for another 15 minutes, until the salmon was done. If using a conventional grill, grill the salmon over a low/medium flame at 450F with the lid closed for 20 to 22 minutes, until the edges of the salmon are golden. Grill the asparagus for 10 minutes over a low flame, turning occasionally.</p>
                              <p>The salmon can be served directly off the plank with a side of asparagus and a few lemon wedges.</p>

                              3 lb beef
                              3 medium carrots
                              2 medium onions
                              1 head of garlic
                              1 lb mushrooms
                              3/4 cup dry red
                              1 tbsp garlic powder
                              1 tbsp salt
                              1 tsp pepper</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Dice the veggies into large chunks. If you'd like, leave the onions whole. Cut the top off a garlic head and leave it whole and unpeeled.</p>
                              <p>Rub the meat generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Brown the meat on all sides on a hot skillet.</p>
                              <p>Add the beef, carrots, onion, garlic, garlic powder, and a teaspoon of salt into the slow cooker.</p>
                              <p>Sauté the mushrooms over high heat and cook them until they turn golden brown on all sides. Pour in the wine and about one cups of hot water.</p>
                              <p>Cook the roast in the slow cooker for about 5 hours, or until the meat easily falls apart when flaked with a fork.</p>
                              <p>Remove the meat from the slow cooker. Spoon out the juice and mushrooms if you wish. Serve the beef in sandwiches, quesadillas, or over mashed potatoes.</p>

                              1 lb ground pork
                              1 lb ground beef

                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Hard boil the eggs for 10-13 minutes and set them aside to cool. Once they come to room temperature, peel off the shells and slice them in half.</p>
                              <p>Remove the bone from the chicken thighs. Using a meat tenderizer, pound the thighs skin side down until very thin.</p>

                              <p>Lay the pounded chicken thighs out on a clean cutting board. Sprinkle them with a little garlic parsley salt. Cover the chicken with a layer of the ground meat mixture. Place two hardboiled egg halves next to each other at either end of the chicken thigh.</p>
                              <p>Starting with the side with the eggs, roll the thigh up tightly into a spiral. Repeat until you've used up all the thighs and ground meat mixture.</p>
                              <p>Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper with the loose sides facing down. Sprinkle with garlic parsley salt and pepper and bake at 325°F for 45 minutes.</p>
                              <p>Remove the roulades from the oven, drain the fat from the pan, and allow them to cool to room temperature. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let them chill in the refrigerator overnight. Slice them into thin pieces and enjoy cold!</p>

                              1 cup Ranch dressing

                              5 cups Broccoli (cut into florets)

                              <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (191 degrees C).</p>
                              <p>f using frozen spinach, thaw and squeeze to drain first. If using broccoli, place it into a pot of water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1-2 minutes until bright green.</p>

                                 Optional tip: If you like extra ranch flavor, add 1-3 teaspoons of ranch seasoning mix, in addition to the dressing.

                              <p>Ingredients:</p>
                              <code>
                              1 tbsp Olive oil
                              4 cloves Garlic (minced)
                              1 1/2 lb Ground beef *
                              6 large Bell peppers
                              2 cup Marinara sauce
                              1 tbsp Italian seasoning
                              1 cup Ricotta cheese *
                              1 cup Mozzarella cheese (shredded)
                              3/4 tsp Sea salt (to taste)
                              1/4 tsp Black pepper (to taste)</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>To prepare the meat sauce, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.</p>
                              <p>Add the ground beef and stir right away so the garlic doesn't burn. Cook for about 10 minutes, breaking apart the meat with a spoon or spatula, until browned.</p>
                              <p>Stir in marinara sauce and Italian seasoning. Add sea salt and black pepper to taste. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 5-8 minutes.</p>
                              <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (191 degrees C).</p>
                              <p>To prepare the peppers, chop off the tops and scoop out the seeds and ribs inside. Slice a tiny layer off the bottoms (without making a hole if possible) so that the peppers are stable standing upright. Place into a medium to large baking dish (this one I use is the perfect size).</p>
                              <p>To assemble, stuff the peppers with 1/4 cup of meat sauce, 2 tablespoons of ricotta cheese, and 2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat with the same amounts again, until the peppers are filled to the top, with mozzarella being the top layer.</p>
                              <p>Tent aluminum foil over the baking dish, making sure the foil is not touching the cheese. Bake stuffed peppers for 30 minutes.</p>
                              <p>
                                 Remove the foil and bake 10 more minutes, until cheese is melted and browned. (If you want extra browning, you can place under the broiler for 1-2 minutes at the end.)

                              <p>Ingredients:</p>
                              <code>
                              2 tbsp Coconut aminos (or low-sodium soy sauce)
                              2 tbsp Shaoxing cooking wine (or sherry cooking wine or beef broth)
                              1 tbsp Arrowroot powder (or 1 tbsp cornstarch, or 1/4 tsp xanthan gum)
                              1 lb Flank steak
                              3 tbsp Avocado oil
                              2 medium Dried Thai chile peppers (crushed or minced; use 1 pepper for less heat)
                              2 cloves Garlic (minced)
                              1/2 tsp Ground ginger
                              1/4 tsp Black pepper
                              Sea salt (optional, to taste)</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Slice the flank steak very thinly against the grain. (If you have time, it can help to place it in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes, which makes it more firm and easier to slice thinly. Don't let it freeze solid.)</p>
                              <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut aminos, cooking wine, and arrowroot powder. Add the sliced beef and toss to coat. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.</p>
                              <p>Heat avocado oil in a large wok over high heat. Add the beef and stir fry for about 1 minute.</p>
                              <p>Add the crushed Thai chile peppers, minced garlic, ground ginger, and black pepper. Stir fry for about another 1-2 minutes, until the beef is cooked through and the sauce is thick and glossy. If needed, add sea salt to taste.</p>

                              <p>Ingredients:</p>
                              <code>
                              4 6-oz Salmon fillets (skin on, about 1 inch thick)
                              1 tsp Sea salt
                              1/4 tsp Black pepper
                              1 tbsp Olive oil
                              4 cloves Garlic (minced)
                              1/2 cup Sun-dried tomatoes (chopped)
                              2 cups Baby spinach (packed)
                              2/3 cup Heavy cream
                              1/3 cup Chicken broth, reduced sodium
                              1/4 cup Grated parmesan cheese</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Use paper towels to pat the salmon fillets completely dry – this will ensure even browning.</p>
                              <p>Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes, until shimmering and hot. (You can test that it’s hot enough by adding a drop of water to the pan; if it sizzles, the pan is ready.)</p>
                              <p>Once the pan is hot, right before you are ready to sear the salmon, season both sides with sea salt and black pepper.</p>
                              <p>Add the fish fillets to the pan in a single layer, skin side down. Use a fish spatula to press down on top of each fillet for the first 10 seconds immediately after adding it to the pan, to prevent curling. Sear, without moving, for 5-6 minutes, until the salmon is 80-90% opaque; only the top will be not quite done.</p>
                              <p>Use the fish spatula to flip the salmon fillets. Cook the salmon for about 1-2 minutes, until the salmon internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), which is done medium.</p>
                              <p>Remove the salmon to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.</p>
                              <p>Reduce heat to medium. Add the minced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes to the pan. Saute for 1-2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant.</p>
                              <p>Add the chicken broth and heavy cream. Bring the sauce to a gentle boil, then simmer for about 5 minutes, until the volume is reduced by 1/4.</p>
                              <p>Add the spinach and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the spinach is just barely wilted.</p>
                              <p>Reduce heat to low. Stir in the grated parmesan cheese, stirring constantly, until smooth and melted. (You can add salt and pepper to taste here, but I didn’t find it necessary.)</p>
                              <p>Return the salmon to the pan, skin side down, and spoon the sauce over the fish. If you like it done more than medium, heat for a few more minutes, until done to your liking. </p>

                              1 tsp Sea salt
                              1/2 tsp Black pepper
                              1/2 large Onion (diced)

                              1 1/2 cups Heavy cream
                              1 1/2 cups Grated parmesan cheese
                              3 5-oz cans Solid white albacore tuna (drained)

                              1 1/3 oz Pork rinds (crushed in a blender, ~2/3 cup)
                              1 tbsp Olive oil

                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).</p>
                              <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the yellow squash and season with salt and pepper. Sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, mixing occasionally with tongs, until crisp-tender. Transfer squash noodles to a colander over the sink.</p>
                              <p>Add the onion to the pan and decrease heat to medium. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until translucent.</p>
                              <p>Add the bell pepper and garlic. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until peppers and onions are starting to brown.</p>
                              <p>Add the chicken broth. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Increase heat to bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, until the liquid volume is reduced by half.</p>
                              <p>Reduce heat to low. Stir in the heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups of the Parmesan, until the cheese melts and sauce is smooth.</p>
                              <p>Gently stir the tuna into the sauce.</p>
                              <p>Gently press on the noodles in the colander to drain excess water. Transfer to a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Pour the sauce, tuna, and vegetables over the noodles and use tongs to coat.</p>
                              <p>In a small bowl, use a fork to mash together the remaining 1/3 cup of Parmesan, pork rinds, and remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Crumble the mixture over the casserole.</p>
                              <p>
                                 Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until bubbly. Broil for 2 to 4 minutes, until the topping is golden brown.

                              <code>
                              1/2 cup Sunflower seeds
                              1 large Egg
                              2 tbsp Fresh rosemary (chopped)
                              3 cloves Garlic (minced)
                              1 tsp Sea salt
                              1/4 tsp Black pepper
                              1 lb Ground chicken
                              CREAMY SAUCE WITH ROSEMARY AND GARLIC:
                              1 cup Heavy cream (or coconut cream for paleo or whole30)
                              2 tbsp Fresh rosemary (chopped)
                              1/2 tsp Ground thyme
                              2 cloves Garlic (minced)
                              1/2 tsp Sea salt (start with 1/4 tsp and adjust to taste after sauce thickens)
                              1 pinch Black pepper</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Grease it if using foil.</p>
                              <p>In a high-power blender or food processor, pulse the sunflower seeds until they are a fine "meal" consistency. Be careful not to over-process, or you'll make seed butter.</p>
                              <p>Transfer the sunflower seed meal to a bowl. Whisk in the egg. Stir in the rosemary, garlic, sea salt, and black pepper.</p>
                              <p>Add the ground chicken. Use your hands to mix until just incorporated. Do not over-mix.</p>
                              <p>Form 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls and place onto the lined baking sheet. (A small cookie scoop works well for this.) </p>
                              <p>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until barely cooked through. Switch to broil and broil for 3 more minutes.</p>
                              <p>While the meatballs are baking, make the sauce. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until thick and reduced in volume by half. The sauce should easily coat the back of a spoon. If it becomes too thick, you can thin it out with more cream. Adjust salt to tast</p>
                              <p> When the meatballs are done, skewer with appetizer forks and drizzle the sauce over them. It comes out to about 3/4 tsp (4 mL) of sauce per meatball. Alternatively, toss the meatballs in the sauce for a meal.</p>

                              Parmesan grated over the top to serve

                              <p>Place a large 12-inch non-reactive skillet over medium heat, add 1 Tbsp olive oil and breakfast sausage. Sauté 5 minutes or until browned, breaking it up with a spatula, then transfer to a plate.</p>
                              <p>Melt in butter, add diced onion and sauté 4-5 minutes until soft and golden. Add garlic and stir another 30 seconds.</p>
                              <p>Add tomatoes with their juice and roughly break up the tomatoes with a spatula. Stir in 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp sugar to the pan, reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and breaking up the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Simmer until tomatoes are no longer watery but saucy and thick enough to create wells for the eggs.</p>
                              <p>Crack in 5 eggs into wells and lightly sprinkle salt on each egg.</p>
                              <p>Sprinkle cooked sausage around eggs then top with parsley. Cover and simmer on low heat 5-8 min (depending on desired doneness – check at 5 min) or until whites are cooked through and yolks are still soft and moist. Remove from heat and serve with freshly grated parmesan and toasted bread.</p>

                              <code>
                              4 8-oz Boneless skinless chicken breasts
                              1 tsp Sea salt
                              1/4 tsp Black pepper
                              2 tbsp Olive oil (plus more if needed in step 4)
                              4 cloves Garlic (minced)
                              6 oz Cremini mushrooms (sliced; ~2 cups)
                              1 tbsp Unsalted butter
                              1/2 cup Chicken broth, reduced sodium
                              1/4 cup Dry white wine
                              1 cup Heavy cream
                              1/4 cup Grated parmesan cheese
                              6 cups Fresh spinach (packed</code>
                              <p>Instructions:</p>
                              <p>Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</p>
                              <p>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil, until shimmering. Add the chicken breasts in a single layer and cook for 3-5 minutes per side, until golden brown on the outside. (The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point, just browned.)</p>
                              <p>Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.</p>
                              <p>If the pan is dry, add a little more oil. (Do not wipe the skillet.) Add the garlic and mushrooms to the pan. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid evaporates. (Keep the heat at medium-high so that the moisture evaporates as the mushrooms release liquid, but you can reduce heat if they start to brown too much.)</p>
                              <p>Reduce heat to medium. Stir in the butter, until melted.</p>
                              <p>Add the chicken broth and white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits (this is called deglazing).</p>
                              <p>Increase heat to bring to a simmer. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, until the volume of the liquid is reduced by half.</p>
                              <p>Add the heavy cream. Increase heat to bring to a simmer, then cook for about 2-3 minutes, until slightly thickened.</p>
                              <p>Reduce heat to low, to stop simmering. Stir in the grated parmesan cheese, until smooth.</p>
                              <p>Add the spinach to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes, until wilted.</p>
                              <p>Return the chicken to the pan, nestling it in the sauce. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.</p>
